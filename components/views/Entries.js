        <h1 class="entriesHead">Catch Of The Week</h1>
        
        <p class="entriesInfo">This will be a strictly honor based system as we have no way, right now, of confirming any information.  Perhaps in the future this can evolve into a little more serious contest, but for now it is just for fun. So, let's have some fun and keep it clean.  In addition, this will not be a strictly biggest fish contest.  While we can all agree that a 30 plus inch Northern Pike is a great catch.  In comparison, a 2 1/2 pound bluegill would probably take home the prize.  Other factors will be considered too.  Please provide any and all relevant details, and try to add a photo that gives some idea of the scale of the size of the fish.  This doesn't mean holding it out way in front of you to make it look bigger, or placing a bluegill on a teacup saucer to make it look like it overflows a dinner plate.  Think beer can, etc...  Anyways, let's see what you got, and keep those lines tight!    <a href="" class="entriesInfoAnchor">Enter Here</a></p>
