# Definition Of Audience
If you want to find fish, this is your website.  Ultimately, the target audience will be anglers across America with the knowledge, ability, and desire to use the internet to find good fishing areas.  Along the way I will look for input and feedback from my mentors. peers, and career coaches, hoping that my product will catch the attention of recruiters and hiring managers.

# Definition Statement
I want to create a web application that makes information on public fishing areas easily accessible to fishermen everywhere.  This website will search available places to fish based on the users location and/or targeted species of fish.

# High Level Story / Elevator Pitch
Growing up in central Michigan, there was never a shortage of areas to fish.  Although the area I lived in was known as the farthest you could get from any of the Great Lakes, that did not mean that there was not plenty of water to be found.  Minnesota is known as the Land of 10,000 Lakes.  Well, Michigan has 14,000 in a considerably smaller area of land, so you were never really more than a few miles away from good fishing.  Later on I moved to Colorado, where I lived for 12 years.  While, their lakes were not as abundant; there were still lots of reservoirs and trout streams to be found.  Then I came to St. Louis and all of a sudden, finding a good place to fish became extremely challenging.  Only through much research and time in local bait shops did I finally start finding some decent places around here. So, to help prevent anglers from experiencing similar frustration in the future, I give you the FishNet.
